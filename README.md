# TripPlanner
### Goal:
User should be able to enter latitude, longitude, city name, coordinates, etc. for each city they are adding to the trip. Some cities are already added upon running.

Each city added will then be added to the Trip Planner. Total mileage will be calculated.

Pressing new creates a new trip with no added cities and a total mileage of 0.

Ability to add, remove, and update trip.
